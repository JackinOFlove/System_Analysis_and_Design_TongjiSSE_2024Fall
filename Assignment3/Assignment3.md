## 1.4. Progress on System Design

In the previous report, we have completed the analytical model design of the KeepFit intelligent Fitness system, and presented in detail the user interface, system architecture and class diagram in this section. Based on the results of these preliminary work, this document further clarifies and improves the micro-service architecture design of the platform. We will provide more specific technical architecture and logical architecture models, and design detailed interfaces for the different modules of the project. The paper will also thoroughly describe the use of some third-party API, the design of an interface of the sub-system, the implementation of the analysis mechanism, the specific operation of the use case and the design of the system prototype. We focused on the specific implementation design of the project, elaborated on the main technology stack needed to achieve the project, and defined the specific way in which the project was implemented.

The improvement and enhancement of the platform design are mainly reflected in the following aspects:

+ **Reconfigure the logical structure and functional mechanisms**

Through in-depth analysis of the mechanism and functions of the platform, we redesigned the logical structure of the system, and optimized and adjusted the various functions of the system to meet the actual needs of the project.

+ **Add technical and physical architecture design**

In addition to the original logical architecture, we also further expand the design of the technical architecture and the physical architecture. For each function of the layer, we detail the required technology stack and provide the deployment scheme of the system at the physical level to ensure the efficient operation of the system.

+ **Optimize the interface design and detailed description**

We have carried out more detailed planning in interface design, providing new subsystems and various modules with more specific interface design, including the type of interface parameters, return value type and details of data transmission. For the interfaces of third-party services and some subsystems, we have also made detailed instructions to ensure the smooth and stable interface call.

+ **Improve the safety and reliability of the system**

To improve the security and reliability of the platform, we have adopted the API gateway, the data persistence mechanism, and a range of design solutions. These designs effectively enhance the fault tolerance, flexibility, and scalability of the system, ensuring that the platform operates stably in a high-concurrency, high-load environment.

+ **Analyze the mechanism and select the appropriate design mode**

We have made an in-depth analysis of the mechanism in the platform and selected the most suitable design mode to improve the performance and scalability of the system and ensure the scientific and high efficiency of the system design.

+ **System analysis and design by using the design mode**

In the analysis and design process of the system, we have widely used a variety of design modes to ensure that the system has good maintainability, scalability and high efficiency.

+ **Practice part of the project development work and propose the prototype design**

In the actual development process, we personally participated in the construction of some project modules, carried out the development and implementation of some functions, and proposed the system prototype design, so as to better verify the feasibility and user experience of the system.

+ **Combine the user use case and the system structure analysis and implementation mode**

By combining user use cases with the system structure of the platform, we deeply analyzed the implementation process of the system to ensure that each use case can be efficiently connected with the system architecture, so as to improve the overall performance and user experience of the system.

Through these improvements and enhancements, this design document not only provides a more detailed and clear diagram of the system architecture, but also ensures that the platform can operate efficiently during the implementation process to meet the needs of future expansion and innovation.

## 1.5. The Platform and Architecture

In the actual development process, we will use a microservice architecture to develop our KeepFit intelligent fitness system. The architecture enables each microservice in the system to be deployed independently and loosely coupled to each other. Each microservice focuses on completing a single function and implementing it in an optimum way. This architecture design brings low coupling, high flexibility, specific solutions to specific problems, and is conducive to independent development. In addition, the microservice architecture also enhances the availability and stability of the system. Under this architecture, we will use a series of mature technologies and frameworks to build the system. The implementation of each subsystem and component is summarized as follows:

+ **Web application**

We will use Flutter, Material-UI, Panache, Supernova, Sylph, Codemagic and other tools to build the front-end framework, and use AJAX technology to dynamically update the page content without refreshing the page to improve the user experience.

+ **API gateway**

The API gateway will be implemented through Spring Cloud Alibaba, as a unified external interface to provide microservice support. Spring Cloud Alibaba provides key components for building distributed applications, allowing developers to easily develop and manage various services in the microservice architecture through the Spring Cloud programming model.

+ **Security**

The security certification of the system will use Sa-Token, a lightweight licensing framework that can meet the security requirements of the platform. Certification and authorization through this framework can effectively guarantee the security of the platform and support security testing. 

+ **Data storage**

In terms of data storage, we will combine a variety of database technologies. The relational database MySQL is used to store structured data, the document database MongoDB is used to store unstructured data, MinIO will be used for object storage, and Redis provides efficient cache and data consistency support in high concurrency scenarios to ensure the security and high availability of data. 

+ **Service framework**

Backend development will be based on Spring Boot, using its strong scalability and excellent performance to build server systems. We will develop using the Java language, and Spring Boot provides the ideal environment for developing high-performance, scalable network applications.

Through the integrated application of these technologies and frameworks, we are able to build an efficient, stable and highly scalable microservice architecture system to meet the various needs of the KeepFit intelligent fitness platform.

## 1.6. Architecture Style

In the modern software architecture design, we abandon the traditional single architecture and instead adopt a more flexible and efficient microservice architecture. The core idea of this architecture style is to deconstruct complex systems into multiple lightweight, independent and autonomous service units, with each micro-service focused on performing specific business functions. With this decentralized design approach, we significantly improve the overall performance and resilience of the system. Unlike traditional single large applications, the micro-service architecture allows development teams to respond more quickly to changing business requirements, enabling rapid iteration of technology and business through loosely coupled service design. Each micro-service is a relatively independent business boundary, with its own data storage, business logic and communication interface, thus forming a highly decoupled and portfolio system ecosystem.

Due to the high completeness and independence of the services provided by HW, it can be conveniently packaged into different microservice clusters and applied to other systems. Therefore, the system adopts the micro-service architecture design, with the characteristics of high cohesion and low coupling, and each service can be deployed independently. The microservice architecture also has the advantages of flexible development, support for rapid iteration and update, which can well meet the functional requirements of the current system. In the microservice architecture, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the design of individual applications, as described below.

According to the classification of software architecture styles by Garlan and Shaw, software architecture styles are mainly divided into the following five categories:

+ **Data flow style** including batch sequence and pipeline / filter mode.
+ **Call / return style** including the master program / subprogram, object-oriented style, and hierarchy.
+ **Independent component style** including inter-process communication and event-driven systems.
+ **Virtual machine style** including interpreter and rule-based systems.
+ **Warehouse style** including database system, hypertext system and blackboard system.

In designing the system, the overall architecture adopts a call / return style, with a focus on data-based abstraction and object-oriented design concepts. In the hierarchical design, we gradually expand from local to whole to ensure that the system has clear hierarchy and good scalability while meeting the requirements.

## 1.7. Design Patterns

In the development process of the intelligent fitness platform, we follow the following design patterns:

+ **Singleton Pattern**

The singleton mode is a common design mode, designed to ensure that a class has only one instance, and that it provides a global access point to obtain that instance. By using the singleton mode, you can avoid resource waste and management problems caused by creating multiple instances, especially for data or services that require global sharing.

In our smart fitness system, we use the singleton mode to manage the data of the current users. After the user logs in, the current user information is saved in a singleton class to ensure that this unique user data is shared by other modules in the application without repeating user objects. At the same time, the default Settings of the fitness plan or the global system configuration (such as the reward system, AI detection rules, etc.) can be managed in the singleton mode to ensure the consistency and global accessibility of the configuration items.

![singleton](.\assets\singleton.png)

+ **Observer Pattern**

The observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency that allows multiple observers to listen on the state changes of a single subject object. When the state of a subject object changes, all observers who depend on it are notified and automatically updated.

In our intelligent fitness system, the observer mode can be used for multiple scenarios, such as the user subscribing to their own target progress update, the fitness plan management module as the theme, and the user interface or the notification module as the observer, and the user can view the progress of the task in real time. When the user's fitness progress changes, multiple observers will receive notification and automatically update relevant content, such as reward distribution, data statistics, etc.

![observer](.\assets\observer.png)

+ **Strategy Pattern**

The strategy mode allows for the selection of the behavior of the algorithm at runtime. In strategy patterns, a series of algorithms is defined and each algorithm is encapsulated into a separate class so that they are interchangeable. The strategy mode makes the algorithm change independent of the customer using the algorithm.

In our intelligent fitness system, different recommendation algorithm strategies are selected according to users' needs and preferences. For example, users prefer to learn through a video tutorial and can choose a content recommendation strategy. The recommendation system can flexibly switch between different recommendation algorithms through the strategy pattern to improve the user experience.

![strategy](.\assets\strategy.png)

+ **Responsibility Chain Pattern**

The responsibility chain mode is a behavioral design mode that forms a chain by connecting multiple processing objects in series to form a chain in which a client request passes along the chain until an object processes the request. The main purpose of this pattern is to give multiple objects the opportunity to process the request, thus avoiding the coupling between the request sender and the receiver.

In the intelligent fitness system, the responsibility chain mode can be used to process a series of fitness tasks, user operation requests, data processing processes, etc. Especially when a request or operation needs to go through multiple processing steps, such as the training task audit process, the user feedback processing process, and the user training plan update process.

![chain-of-responsibility](.\assets\chain-of-responsibility.png)

+ **Proxy Pattern**

The proxy mode provides a proxy for other objects to control the access to that object. The agent mode accesses the real objects indirectly by introducing the agent objects. The agent objects can perform some additional operations before and after accessing the real objects, such as permission control, delayed loading, caching, etc.

In smart fitness systems, video tutorials may require permission control. Only users who have purchased or unlocked the relevant tutorial can access the video content. Using proxy mode, proxy objects can control access to video tutorials, ensuring that only authorized users can watch it. At the same time, the proxy object can create an AI object on the first request and call the object directly in later requests, rather than creating every time, thus improving performance.

![proxy](.\assets\proxy.png)

## 1.8. Critical Design Decisions

+ In our system, all images and video resources uploaded by users are stored in Alibaba Cloud OSS and returned to the front-end for display through generated URLs. This approach not only provides high reliability and availability, ensuring secure and stable access to data, but also supports high concurrency processing and low latency, enhancing the user experience.
+ The microservice architecture we use is extremely flexible, can adapt well to the agile development process, and has advantages beyond traditional architectures in terms of system reconstruction and continuous integration. In addition, the deployment and expansion of the micro-service architecture enable us to make full use of the advantages of the cloud platform in the operation and maintenance process, effectively control costs and improve the maintainability of the system.
+ In every link of the system design, we always put the user privacy protection in the first place. In addition to the strict permission control based on sa-token, we also plan to implement encryption at the database level and adopt disk-level hardware encryption technology to ensure the security of user data. In the process of data collection and analysis, we will use desensitized data, so as to effectively protect user privacy.
+ Using ElPlus and Vue to build our UI: Vue as a popular front-end framework provides an efficient development experience and a flexible component structure that can quickly respond to user needs. The introduction of ElPlus further improves the standardization and consistency of UI design, making the front-end interface more modern and user-friendly, thus bringing a smoother user experience.
+ Based on the concept of object-oriented programming, combined with the domain-specific technology stack: our projects mainly use the Springboot technology stack for development and process most of the business logic. However, in some specific services, thanks to the flexibility of the micro-service architecture, we adopt a dedicated technology stack in the corresponding field to improve the development efficiency and system performance.

# 2. Architecture Refinement

## 2.1. Platform-dependent Architecture

In the previous logical architecture design of our Keep Fit Platform, we focused heavily on the completeness of internal system functions and the security of data transmission. However, considering the increasing number of users and business complexity, the original layered architecture has gradually exposed some problems, such as poor system scalability, low development and deployment efficiency, and wide impact of failures. Therefore, we have decided to adopt a microservices architecture based on Domain Driven Design (DDD) to improve and upgrade the system logic architecture.

+ **Microservices Segmentation**

Our platform can be divided into multiple microservices that are both interrelated and relatively independent:

1. **Login and Registration Microservice**: Handles user login and registration functions.
2. **Fitness Tutorial Microservice**: Includes features such as fitness tutorial recommendations, learning, and fitness check-ins.
3. **AI Fitness Coach Microservice**: Includes features such as using AI to analyze whether users' fitness movements are standard, recommending fitness equipment, intelligent Q&A with fitness equipment, and intelligent price comparison for fitness equipment.
4. **Healthy Diet Microservice**: Includes features such as users setting meal plans based on system recommendations, recording dietary intake, and AI analysis of dietary habits.

+ **Microservices Integration**

Previously, we had separated AI fitness movement analysis and fitness equipment into two subsystems. However, this time we have merged them into a single microservice. This is because these two functions are highly related in actual use. Merging them allows for better coordination and optimization of user workflows, reduces inter-service communication overhead, and improves overall performance.

+ **Interdependencies Between Microservices**

1. **Fitness Tutorial Microservice** influences the fitness equipment recommendation function in the **AI Fitness Coach Microservice**. When users learn specific fitness tutorials, the system recommends appropriate fitness equipment based on the tutorial content.
2. **Fitness Check-in Function** in the **Fitness Coach Microservice** must be validated by the **AI Fitness Coach Microservice** to ensure that the user's fitness movements are standard. Only when the user's movements meet the standards will the system record a successful check-in.
3. **Healthy Diet Microservice** recommends meal plans based on the ongoing fitness tutorials in the **Fitness Tutorial Microservice**. After AI analysis of the user's dietary habits, it intelligently adjusts the fitness plan in the **Fitness Tutorial Microservice**. For example, if a user is undergoing high-intensity training, the system might suggest increasing protein intake.

+ **Advantages of Adopting a Microservices Architecture**

1. **Improved Development Efficiency**: Teams can develop different microservices in parallel, accelerating development and delivery speeds.
2. **Independent Deployment and Scaling**: Each microservice can be independently deployed and scaled without affecting other services, enhancing the system's flexibility and maintainability.
3. **Fault Isolation**: A failure in one service does not affect others, improving the system's stability and reliability.
4. **Continuous Delivery and Support**: Supports Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), facilitating rapid iteration and feature releases.

Based on the above content, the logical architecture of this system is as follows:

![Layer](.\assets\Layer.png)

+ **Technical Stack for the Microservices Architecture**

To ensure the microservices architecture scales effectively with the project size, we continue to use separate front-end and back-end development approaches. The front-end is developed using frameworks and libraries such as Vue and Sencha, while the back-end is built using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. Communication between the front-end and back-end occurs through RESTful APIs and JSON data files. Data layers communicate and transform data using different models, such as Value Objects (VO), Data Transfer Objects (DTO), and Domain Objects (DO).

For authorization and authentication, the system uses sa-token. Comprehensive log collection and data analysis visualization are provided by the ELK stack. To efficiently handle asynchronous messages and traffic management, ActiveMQ is used for message passing and storage. The back-end persists data to Oracle databases or Redis caches using the Hibernate persistence mechanism.

Based on these technologies, the technical stack diagram for the system is as follows:

![SystemArchitecture](.\assets\SystemArchitecture.png)

Combining the technical architecture and the microservice architecture, we ensure the integrity and correctness of the system design, and improve the scalability and flexibility of the system by dividing the independent service modules. In the design process, we focus on the interface between the services, the data flow and the dependencies, and finally form the data and technical service model diagram:

![DataAndtechnicalserviceModel](.\assets\DataAndtechnicalserviceModel.png)

## 2.2. Subsystems and Interfaces

According to the principle of domain-driven design, to ensure that the business logic of the system is implemented efficiently and accurately, we divide the individual business functions in the system into five main areas. This division not only helps to clarify the scope of responsibility in each field, but also ensures that the degree of coupling between services in each field is minimized, thus optimizing the overall structure and maintainability of the system.

+ **Login and Registration Subsystem**
+ **Fitness Tutorial Subsystem**
+ **Fitness Action Coaching System**
+ **Fitness Equipment System**
+ **Healthy Diet Subsystem**

Based on the above domain design, in order to meet the demand for moderately granular services in the system design, we further divide the microservices into the following specific subsystems. This division is functionally oriented and aims to ensure that each subsystem can independently assume specific responsibilities, while maintaining low-coupling relationships with other subsystems.

+ **Login and Registration Service Subsystem**
+ **Fitness Tutorial Subsystem**
+ **Fitness Action Coaching System**
+ **Fitness Equipment System**
+ **Healthy Diet Subsystem**
  + Dietary Record Module
  + Dietary Plan Module

## 2.3. Interface Specification

Since the intelligent fitness system platform involves different roles and authority management, in order to ensure the privacy security of data and the efficiency of information transmission in the process of system operation, the project needs to include a special security service module, responsible for user login authentication and authority control. Considering that the front and back end architecture of the system is separated, and there are a series of requirements, such as authentication and security access, we chose sa-token as the security framework. The sa-token isa lightweight and powerful framework capable of providing efficient, flexible authentication and licensing capabilities. By using sa-token, we can effectively manage the permissions of different user roles, ensure the data security of the system, while ensuring the fluency of user operation and the efficiency of the authentication process, so as to support the stable operation and rapid iteration of the system.

### 2.3.1. Internal Interface Description

+ **Login Authentication**

Before users can access the various features of our project, they must first authenticate their login credentials. This is necessary because access to certain operational interfaces is restricted to authorized users only. Login authentication serves as a prerequisite for performing any operations that require authenticated user permissions.

To ensure smooth and secure user interactions, the sa-token framework is utilized to manage the login process. It provides a set of API interfaces that allow the system to check the current login status, as well as retrieve token-related information such as validity, expiration, and user identity. These interfaces seamlessly integrate with other parts of the system, enabling efficient authentication management and facilitating subsequent user operations that require authentication.

By leveraging the sa-token framework, our project can ensure that all operations are performed securely and only by authenticated users, enhancing both functionality and security across the platform.
