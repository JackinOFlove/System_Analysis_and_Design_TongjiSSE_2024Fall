# **4. Specific Requirement**

## 4.1. Agile development and requirement analysis

- **Persona**

The primary goal of developing the âKeep Fitâ platform is to create a comprehensive, all-inclusive fitness solution tailored specifically for fitness enthusiasts. In order to ensure the platform meets the diverse needs of its users, during the system function exploration phase, this document outlines a detailed analysis of various types of users. These user profiles are categorized based on individual personality traits, unique characteristics, living environments, and personal values. Building upon this analysis, a detailed user persona has been developed to better understand and address the specific requirements and preferences of different user groups. This approach helps ensure that the platform is intuitive, accessible, and effective for all users, regardless of their fitness backgrounds or lifestyles.

<img src=".\assets\Persona.png" alt="Persona" style="zoom:75%;" />

- **Empathy map**

Depending on the profiles of different users, we can build an empathy map from the user's perspective. Through in-depth analysis of users 'thinking, language expression, daily experiences, behaviors and emotional states, we can better understand users' needs and confusion in daily life. With the help of this analysis, we can optimize the functions of the system to make it more suitable for users' real use scenarios, so as to provide more personalized and targeted services. This design idea from the user's perspective will help us improve the user experience of the system and meet the diverse needs.

<img src="./assets/Empathy map.png" alt="Empathy map" width="380" />

- **User story**

By summarizing and analyzing different user portraits and empathy maps, we have a deep understanding of the expectations and needs of various users for the system. Through these analyses, we can not only grasp the user's behavior patterns, pain points and goals, but also can more accurately identify the specific problems and challenges they encounter in the process of use. These valuable insights allow us to fully show the real needs of our users and express them in the form of their user stories.This approach not only helps us to better navigate the product during the design and development phase, but also ensures that the features we develop are highly compatible with the core needs of the users, thus improving the satisfaction of the user experience and the overall practicality of the system.

<img src="./assets/UserStory.png" alt="UserStory" width="380"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- **User journey map**

In the system design process, the user stories are classified according to the needs of different users, and the user interaction steps of the users with the system are gradually described to help them achieve their respective goals. This process not only focuses on the user's behavior during the operating system, but also tracks their psychological changes at different stages. By building the user journey map, we can intuitively understand the user's emotional fluctuations during use, identify pain points and opportunities for improvement. This approach helps us optimize the system functionality design, ensuring that each new feature better meets the user needs and provides a smoother experience.

<img src="./assets/journey map.png" alt="journey map" style="zoom:80%;" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- **User story map**

On this basis, we can deeply analyze the most urgent needs of the system, as well as some excellent ideas that can be improved. By sequencing the urgency of these needs, we mapped the user stories. User story maps can not only help us build use-case models, but also assign team tasks properly. Based on the concept of agile development, we can develop a feasible version of the system in the shortest time, and constantly update the system according to the needs of users, so as to ensure that the functions of the system are more in line with the actual needs of users and improve the user experience. At the same time, this approach also improves the development efficiency, ensuring that the team can quickly respond to market changes and user feedback during each iteration cycle, and continuously optimize the system functions.
